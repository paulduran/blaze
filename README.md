Info
----
Blaze is an alternative to the standard campfire web client.

I decided to build it because the existing campfire web client was rather clunky and outdated. It does full-page refreshes when changing tabs, logs you out if you sit in the lobby tab for too long and doesnt support desktop notifications.

Please report any bugs or feature requests via the github issues board.
